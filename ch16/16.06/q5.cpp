// In this quiz, implement the game as follows:

// Numbers divisible by only 3 should print “fizz”.
// Numbers divisible by only 5 should print “buzz”.
// Numbers divisible by only 7 should print “pop”.
// Numbers divisible by only 11 should print “bang”.
// Numbers divisible by only 13 should print “jazz”.
// Numbers divisible by only 17 should print “pow”.
// Numbers divisible by only 19 should print “boom”.
// Numbers divisible by more than one of the above should print each of the words associated with its divisors.
// Numbers not divisible by any of the above should just print the number.

// Use a std::vector to hold the divisors, and another std::vector to hold the words (as type std::string_view). 
// If the arrays do not have the same length, the program should assert. Produce output for 150 numbers.
